## Topic:

##### Hydraulic fracturing and earthquakes in Oklahoma

Human-induced earthquakes are becoming an important topic in political and scientific discussions and is now vastly reported by the media. It is well known that surface and underground mining, reservoir depletion, injection and withdrawal of fluids and gas from the subsurface are capable of inducing slip on preexisting faults and potentially earthquakes of various magnitudes. Since 2009, new drilling technologies have given access to oil and gas in previously unproductive geological formations. In this project we try to predict the seismicity in Oklahoma based on the number of disposal wells and the history of the volume of saltwater injected.

## Data Sources:

We collect some data from the **Oklahoma Geological Survey** on the history of earthquake events localized in Oklahoma state during the past century. From their website http://www.okgeosurvey1.gov we can access an Earthquakes catalog which gives us precious information on the data, location and magnitude of earthquakes.



The water disposal wells data was taken from the **Oklahoma Corporation Commision, Oil and Gas Department website**. Among the numerous files, we opted for a dataset that contained both the year that the well was reported to the Oil and gas department and the location in coordinates.
